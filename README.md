# Scala Workshop

This repository is the workshop project created as a complementary for the `scala-training-basics` course content.

## Introduction

The FootballMania application reads a CSV file of a league/season and prints out results of a particular team in JSON.

The CSV files for some leagues and seasons can be downloaded from: https://github.com/footballcsv.

Application accepts 2 arguments, team name and the location ("home" or "away").
* If user enters no arguments, or invalid location, program prints an error.
* If there are no games found, then empty Json array is returned.

## Goal

The goal of the workshop is to complete the implementations of the methods. Unit tests should pass for all implementations.

## Solution

The complete solution is available at the `solution` branch.
